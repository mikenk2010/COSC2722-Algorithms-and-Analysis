### ✅ SECTION A: Short Answer (Answer all questions)

1. **Time Complexity Concept:**  
   Explain the meaning of Big-O notation. Give three examples of algorithm complexities and describe their best use cases.

2. **Algorithm Design:**  
   Describe an algorithm to find the second largest number in an unsorted array without sorting. What is its time complexity?

3. **Proof Question:**  
   Given: T(N) = 999N - sqrt(N). Prove that T(N) = O(N).

4. **Permutation Logic:**  
   Explain how to determine if two sequences are permutations of each other using only basic ADTs like sets and queues.

### ✅ SECTION B: Algorithm Coding (Write Java Code)

5. **Missing Number Finder:**  
   Write a method that finds the missing value in an array containing N unique values from 0 to N.

6. **Balanced Expression Validator:**  
   Write a Java method to check if a string expression of brackets is balanced. Support `()`, `{}`, and `[]`.

7. **Unique Elements:**  
   Implement two methods to print unique integers in an array: one with nested loops and one with sorting. Compare their time complexities.

8. **BST Traversals:**  
   Implement the following traversal methods for a binary search tree:  
   a. Pre-order  
   b. In-order  
   c. Post-order  
   d. Breadth-first (Level-order)

### ✅ SECTION C: Applied Problem Solving

9. **Airport Gate Allocation:**  
   Given arrays of arrival and departure times, write a method to calculate the minimum number of gates required to avoid flight overlap.

10. **Closest to Zero Sum:**  
    Given an array of integers, find the pair whose sum is closest to zero.

11. **Cycle Removal in Linked List:**  
    Implement Floyd’s Cycle Detection algorithm to detect and remove a cycle in a singly linked list.

12. **Check for BST:**  
    Write a recursive method that validates whether a given binary tree is a valid BST.

13. **ATM Queue Simulation:**  
    Simulate an ATM queue using arrival and duration arrays. Calculate max and average wait time.

### ✅ SECTION D: Advanced Structures

14. **Josephus Circle Problem:**  
    Implement the Josephus problem using a circular linked list. Explain the logic behind node elimination.

15. **Node Distance and LCA:**  
    Given a binary tree, write methods to:  
    a. Find the level of a node  
    b. Calculate the distance (number of edges) between any two nodes

16. **Lower Bound Search in BST:**  
    Write a method to find the node in a BST such that its value is the smallest among values greater than or equal to X.

17. **2D Matrix Sum:**  
    Implement a method to compute the sum of all numbers within a sub-rectangle in a static matrix, given (top, left) and (bottom, right) coordinates.
